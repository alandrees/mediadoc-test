# mediadoc-test
This is the code for the mediadoc test application

To install:

Browse to your http directory, add issue the following command:

  git clone https://github.com/alandrees/mediadoc-test.git

I have included an sqlite database for ease of portability, you'll need the sqlite php module loaded to run it.
